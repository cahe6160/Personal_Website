# Personal_Website 

Hi! Thank you so much for checking out my personal website! 
-----------------------------------------------------------
To host locally download the latest version of node.js @ https://nodejs.org/en/

then open terminal and type: sudo npm install http-server -g (sudo is only for mac and -g is to make this server global)

then go to the directory where my website is and type http-server

then open a window and type localhost:8080 and you should see my website (it starts in index.html by clicking my name)

Thanks again for stopping by!

*note - if you can, use chrome!*
